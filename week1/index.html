      <bold>Notes:</bold><br>
      <li>“If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, 
        then you will focus on the content, and your core functionality. 
        That leads to simple, beautiful apps. If you do it the other way around, 
        it’ll be like trying to put a marshmallow into a piggy bank, 
        which is neither simple, nor beautiful.”</li><br>
      <li>Focusing on mobile first, it forces you to start small and then scale up.</li><br>
      <li>Mobile is not going to go away, it’s most likely just going to continue to grow in importance.</li><br>
      <li>UX design should be immediate, relevant, and frictionless. So be quick</li><br>
      <li>Loading speeds really matter for any devices that are using a mobile network</li><br>
      <li>Placement matters, make sure designs for mobile devices put all primary menus are easy to reach 
        (as close to the bottom right hand corner).
      </li><br>
      <li>Mobile forces you to do everything simply</li><br>
